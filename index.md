# Basic Coding
Start by going into the `.ras` file we made

Then we'll start out by making a simple Hello World Program

Write:
```
print Hello World!
```
* `print` writes text to the terminal
* `Hello World!` is the text we want to print

Then we're done! lets test it out

In the terminal write

```bash
python ras-run.py app.ras
```
lets see our final product!
