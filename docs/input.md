# User Input

RAS Lang allows user input

This means that we can ask the user for input

* `Input` is like asking a question and if we store it a variable we can get what the user typed
* Here an example of input in Python:

```python
user_input = input("What is your name")
print(user_input)
```

# User Input in RAS Lang
To Perform this action in RAS Lang
Type the following:
```
var input = {What is your name?: }
print $input
```

* `var input` is a variable called input, we do this to get what the user typed
* `{}`, If we put those around our question it is telling the program that this an input action

WOW, that was easy, now you've learned a new skill in RAS Lang :^)
