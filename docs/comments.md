# Comments

* Comments can be used to explain RAS Lang code.

* Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

* Here's an example:

```python
# This code prints "Hi"
print("Hi")
```
# Comments in RAS Lang
To do this look below:

```
# This code prints "Hi"
print Hi
```

* `#` tells the code that this is a comment and will ignore that

Comments are now done!
