# Arrays

* Arrays are used to store multiple values in on single variable
* Ussally, variables only store one value
* An Example in python:

```python
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
```
# Arrays in RAS Lang
To make arrays in RAS Lang, Its very simple, look below to see the code
```
var cars = <Ford>, <Volvo>, <BMW>
```
* `<>`, putting those around our value or object, means that it is an object in our array
* `,` separates the objects in our array
* Lastly we put in a variable

To use this array, look below for code
```
print $cars{0}
```
* `$cars{0}`, the dollar sign means we want our variable cars which is an array,
and the braces mean that we want to get a object from our array, 0 means that we want our first objects and so on

BOOM, a new RAS Lang skill
