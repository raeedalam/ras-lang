# While Loops

* while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
* Here's an example:

```python
while 1 == 1:
  print("1 does equal 1")
```
* the program will keep printing until 1 does not equal 1 and so on

# While loop in RAS Lang
To do this, look at the code below

```
while -> 1 = 1: print 1 does equal 1
```

* `while`, tells the program to start a while loop
* `->`, means we want to check if the statement is true or and will continue printing or more
* `1 = 1` is the statement we want to check
* and can have variables in it
