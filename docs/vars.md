* `Variables` is a number, string, or more and stores data, whatever you make it equal to it repesents that data
* An example of a `Variable` is like this:
```javascript
var name = "Bob"
var number = 2
```
* `var` means that you want to create a variable
* `name, number` is the name of the variable
* `"Bob", 2` is the data the the variable stores are repesents
