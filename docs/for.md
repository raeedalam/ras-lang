# For Loops

* A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence
* Here's and example

```python
array = [bob, ross, duke]
for name in array:
  print name
```

# For Loops in RAS Lang
Look below for code

```
var array = <bob>, <ross>, <duke>
each name -> $array: print this.name
```

* `each` tells the program to run a for/each loop
* `name` is the item iterating name
* `$array` is the array or thing we want to loop and the dollar sign gets the variable array
* `: print this.name` is the code for each item we are looping through and this means to get the the item iterating and name

For loops, check!
