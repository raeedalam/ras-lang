# Info on release v0.3
This release contains a brand new UI design which is easier to use and a new editor! With this release, you need to install the [HaxPro SDK](https://github.com/alamshafil/haxpro-cli/releases) in order to compile and run your apps.

# Ok, what else?
List of new features:
* New UI
* New editor
* Syntax coloring `(Work in Progress)`
* Intellisense `(Work in Progress)`
* New file format `.haxproj`
* Bug fixes
* Updated `Electron` and `NodeJS`

# *Important note*
*Note: For now, there will be only Windows builds, I am trying to port the HaxPro SDK to Linux and macOS.*
